       "= valkyria chronicles iii =   senjō no valkyria 3 : <unk> chronicles ( japanese : 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 , lit . valkyria of the battlefield 3 ) , commonly referred to as valkyria chronicles iii outside japan , is a tactical role @-@ playing video game developed by sega and media.vision for the playstation portable . released in january 2011 in japan , it is the third game in the valkyria series . employing the same fusion of tactical and real @-@ time gameplay as its predecessors , the story runs parallel to the first game and follows the \" nameless \" , a penal military unit serving the nation of gallia during the second europan war who perform secret black operations and are pitted against the imperial unit \" <unk> raven \" .  the game began development in 2010 , carrying over a large portion of the work done on valkyria chronicles ii . while it retained the standard features of the series , it also underwent multiple adjustments , such as making the game more forgiving for series newcomers . character designer <unk> honjou and composer hitoshi sakimoto both returned from previous entries , along with valkyria chronicles ii director takeshi ozawa . a large team of writers handled the script . the game 's opening theme was sung by may 'n .  it met with positive sales in japan , and was praised by both japanese and western critics . after release , it received downloadable content , along with an expanded edition in november of that year . it was also adapted into manga and an original video animation series . due to low sales of valkyria chronicles ii , valkyria chronicles iii was not localized , but a fan translation compatible with the game 's expanded edition was released in 2014 . media.vision would return to the franchise with the development of valkyria : azure revolution for the playstation 4 .   = = gameplay = =   as with previous <unk> chronicles games , valkyria chronicles iii is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . the player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . the route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . after the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . there are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role .  the game 's battle system , the <unk> system , is carried over directly from <unk> chronicles . during missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . a character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters ' turns . each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their action gauge . up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . during gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( hp ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . each character has specific \" potentials \" , skills unique to each character . they are divided into \" personal potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" battle potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . to learn battle potentials , each character has a unique \" masters table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . characters also have special abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : kurt can activate \" direct command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his action point gauge , the character <unk> can shift into her \" valkyria form \" and become invincible , while imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon .  troops are divided into five classes : scouts , <unk> , engineers , lancers and armored soldier . troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon . changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class . with victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games ' method of distributing to different unit types .   = = plot = =   the game takes place during the second europan war . gallian army squad 422 , also known as \" the nameless \" , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign deserters , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and thereon officially referred to by numbers . ordered by the gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the regular army and militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , <unk> <unk> , meaning \" always ready . \" the three main characters are no.7 kurt irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; ace no.1 imca , a female darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the valkyria who destroyed her home ; and no.13 riela <unk> , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the valkyria . together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious imperial unit known as calamity raven , consisting of mostly darcsen soldiers .  as the nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the gallian army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make gallia lose face in the war . while at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . one such member , <unk> , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of calamity raven , attached to the ideal of darcsen independence proposed by their leader , dahau . at the same time , elements within gallian army command move to erase the nameless in order to protect their own interests . hounded by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the gallian war effort . this continues until the nameless 's commanding officer , ramsey crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of <unk> in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the gallian general that had accused kurt of treason .  partly due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the empire , the nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the gallian army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force . this is short @-@ lived , however , as following maximilian 's defeat , dahau and calamity raven move to activate an ancient <unk> super weapon within the empire , kept secret by their benefactor . without the support of maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with gallia , it is dahau 's last trump card in creating a new darcsen nation . as an armed gallian force invading the empire just following the two nations ' cease @-@ fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace , kurt decides to once again make his squad the nameless , asking crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed @-@ in @-@ action . now owing allegiance to none other than themselves , the 422nd confronts dahau and destroys the <unk> weapon . each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew .   = = development = =   concept work for valkyria chronicles iii began after development finished on valkyria chronicles ii in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . the director of valkyria chronicles ii , takeshi ozawa , returned to that role for valkyria chronicles iii . development work took approximately one year . after the release of valkyria chronicles ii , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . like its predecessor , valkyria chronicles iii was developed for playstation portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for valkyria chronicles ii , and they had not come up with the \" revolutionary \" idea that would warrant a new entry for the playstation 3 . speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered valkyria chronicles iii to be the series ' first true sequel : while valkyria chronicles ii had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of valkyria chronicles ii due to being on the same platform . in addition to sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by <unk> the original scenario was written kazuki yamanobe , while the script was written by hiroyuki fujii , koichi majima , <unk> miyagi , seiki <unk> and takayuki <unk> . its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor .  the majority of material created for previous games , such as the <unk> system and the design of maps , was carried over . alongside this , improvements were made to the game 's graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . a part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character 's body . in order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . they also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series ' gameplay . the newer systems were decided upon early in development . the character designs were done by <unk> honjou , who had worked on the previous valkyria chronicles games . when creating the nameless squad , honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the valkyria chronicles world . the main color of the nameless was black . as with the previous valkyria games , valkyria chronicles iii used the <unk> graphics engine . the anime opening was produced by production i.g.   = = = music = = =   the music was composed by hitoshi sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous valkyria chronicles games . when he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other valkyria chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected . an early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . he <unk> the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game . the main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . the rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game 's ending . the battle themes were designed around the concept of a \" modern battle \" divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of atonality . while sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . the guitar was played by mitsuhiro ohta , who also arranged several of the later tracks . the game 's opening theme song , \" if you wish for ... \" ( <unk> , <unk> kimi ga <unk> nara ) , was sung by japanese singer may 'n . its theme was the reason soldiers fought , in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty . its lyrics were written by seiko fujibayashi , who had worked on may 'n on previous singles .   = = = release = = =   in september 2010 , a teaser website was revealed by sega , hinting at a new valkyria chronicles game . in its september issue , famitsu listed that senjō no valkyria 3 would be arriving on the playstation portable . its first public appearance was at the 2010 tokyo game show ( tgs ) , where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees . during the publicity , story details were kept scant so as not to spoil too much for potential players , along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal . to promote the game and detail the story leading into the game 's events , an episodic flash visual novel written by fujii began release in january 2011 . the game was released january 27 , 2011 . during an interview , the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content ( dlc ) , but that no plans were finalized . multiple dlc maps , featuring additional missions and recruitable characters , were released between february and april 2011 . an expanded edition of the game , valkyria chronicles iii extra edition , released on november 23 , 2011 . packaged and sold at a lower price than the original , extra edition game with seven additional episodes : three new , three chosen by staff from the game 's dlc , and one made available as a pre @-@ order bonus . people who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions .  unlike its two predecessors , valkyria chronicles iii was not released in the west . according to sega , this was due to poor sales of valkyria chronicles ii and the general unpopularity of the psp in the west . an unofficial fan translation patch began development in february 2012 : players with a copy of valkyria chronicles iii could download and apply the patch , which translated the game 's text into english . compatible with the extra edition , the patch was released in january 2014 .   = = reception = =   on its day of release in japan , valkyria chronicles iii topped both platform @-@ exclusive and multi @-@ platform sales charts . by early february , the game sold 102 @,@ 779 units , coming in second overall to the last story for the wii . by the end of the year , the game had sold just over 152 @,@ 500 units .  famitsu enjoyed the story , and were particularly pleased with the improvements to gameplay . japanese gaming site game watch impress , despite negatively noting its pacing and elements recycled from previous games , was generally positive about its story and characters , and found its gameplay entertaining despite off @-@ putting difficulty spikes . 4gamer.net writer naohiko <unk> , in a \" play test \" article based on the game 's psn demo , felt that valkyria chronicles iii provided a \" profound feeling of closure \" for the valkyria chronicles series . he praised its gameplay despite annoying limitations to aspects such as special abilities , and positively noted its shift in story to a tone similar to the first game .  playstation official magazine - uk praised the story 's blurring of gallia 's moral standing , art style , and most points about its gameplay , positively noting the latter for both its continued quality and the tweaks to balance and content . its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes , something that had affected the previous games . heath hindman of gaming website playstation lifestyle praised the addition of non @-@ linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from valkyria chronicles ii in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games . he also positively noted the story 's serious tone . points criticized in the review were recycled elements , awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason , pacing issues , and occasional problems with the game 's ai .  in a preview of the tgs demo , ryan geddes of ign was left excited as to where the game would go after completing the demo , along with enjoying the improved visuals over valkyria chronicles ii . kotaku 's richard eisenbeis was highly positive about the game , citing is story as a return to form after valkyria chronicles ii and its gameplay being the best in the series . his main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition , along with expressing regret that it would not be localized .   = = legacy = =   kurt and riela were featured in the nintendo 3ds crossover project x zone , representing the valkyria series . media.vision would return to the series to develop valkyria : azure revolution , with ozawa returning as director . azure revolution is a role @-@ playing video game for the playstation 4 that forms the beginning of a new series within the valkyria franchise .   = = = adaptations = = =   valkyria chronicles 3 was adapted into a two @-@ episode original video animation series in the same year of its release . titled senjō no valkyria 3 : taga tame no <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , lit . valkyria of the battlefield 3 : the wound taken for someone 's sake ) , it was originally released through playstation network and <unk> between april and may 2011 . the initially @-@ planned release and availability period needed to be extended due to a stoppage to psn during the early summer of that year . it later released for dvd on june 29 and august 31 , 2011 , with separate \" black \" and \" blue \" editions being available for purchase . the anime is set during the latter half of valkyria chronicles iii , detailing a mission by the nameless against their imperial rivals calamity raven . the anime was first announced in november 2010 . it was developed by a @-@ 1 pictures , produced by shinji <unk> , directed by nobuhiro kondō , and written by hiroshi <unk> . sakimoto 's music for the game was used in the anime .  the anime 's title was inspired by the principle purpose of the nameless : to suffer in battle for the goals of others . a subtitle attached to the project during development was \" the road to kubinka \" , which referenced the kubinka tank museum in moscow . the game 's main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities , along with general themes focused on war and its consequences . while making the anime , the production team were told by sega to make it as realistic as possible , with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as what happened when vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged . due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its television anime adaptation , the cast of valkyria chronicles could make appearances , which pleased the team . the opening theme , \" akari ( light ) <unk> \" ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , was sung by japanese singer <unk> . the ending theme , \" someday the flowers of light will bloom \" ( <unk> , itsuka saku hikari no hana ) , was sung by minami kuribayashi . both songs ' lyrics were written by their respective artists .  two manga adaptations were produced , following each of the game 's main female protagonists imca and riela . they were senjō no valkyria 3 : namo <unk> <unk> no hana ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 <unk> , lit . valkyria of the battlefield 3 : the flower of the nameless oath ) , illustrated by naoyuki fujisawa and eventually released in two volumes after being serialized in dengeki
